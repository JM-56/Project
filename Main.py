    The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought 
    or oversold conditions in the price of a stock or other asset. 
    
    Traditional interpretation and usage of the RSI are that values of 70 or above indicate that a security (e.g. a stock) is becoming overbought or overvalued and may
     be primed for a trend reversal or corrective pullback in price. An RSI reading of 30 or below indicates an oversold or undervalued condition.

    *MACD*

    Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a securityâ€™s price. 
    The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA.

    The result of that calculation is the MACD line. A nine-day EMA of the MACD called the "signal line," is then plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function 
    as a trigger for buy and sell signals.
