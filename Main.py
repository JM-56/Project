    **Stock Charting**

    This section faciliates stock price charting using line charts, OHLC charts and Canldestick charts. 
    Line charts are plotted with the adjusted close price, this is represented as 'Adj Close' in the dataframe (*more to come on them later*). OHLC and Canldestick 
    charts use the 'Open', 'High', 'Low' and 'Close' columns from the dataframe. 

    Along the bottom of the chart you will see a family of badgers plus a long bar chart, this is shows the volume of stock traded on that day.

    The 'dataframe' is was referring to earlier is basically just a table containing the data. It is called a dataframe in the *library* I am using so I also use this term. 

    **Indicators**
    
    The availabe indicators are RSI, MACD and some averages. I may add more in the *future*, but for now these are all.

    *RSI*

    The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought 
    or oversold conditions in the price of a stock or other asset. 
    
    Traditional interpretation and usage of the RSI are that values of 70 or above indicate that a security (e.g. a stock) is becoming overbought or overvalued and may
     be primed for a trend reversal or corrective pullback in price. An RSI reading of 30 or below indicates an oversold or undervalued condition.

    The formula to calculate RSI is split into two parts:

    Part One:

    *MACD*

    Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a securityâ€™s price. 
    The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA.

    The result of that calculation is the MACD line. A nine-day EMA of the MACD called the "signal line," is then plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function 
    as a trigger for buy and sell signals.

    The formula for MACD:
